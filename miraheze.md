## Thank you
Hello all,

As I write this today, the future of Miraheze doesn't look so promising.

I'm not going to go into anything about why we've ended up in the position we are but it's certainly sad to see.

I would like to thank the team that made Miraheze the amazing community it was though.

Every single one of us who have been involved in the project has made memories. Some of them fun, some of them crazy. We've also made friends that I hope we remain in touch with whatever the next weeks and months bring.

I wish everyone on the project success in whatever they go on to do next and I thank every single one of you who aimed to make Miraheze an amazing community for doing so.
